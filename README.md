# BibleGoAI Research Paper

A LaTeX research paper documenting **BibleGoAI** — an AI/NLP system that synthesizes biblical commentary from 20+ commentators into concise, source-adherent summaries called **Brief Helpful Texts (BHTs)**, served at [BibleGo.org](https://www.biblego.org/).

## What This Paper Covers

This paper is a technical record of the BibleGoAI project — how it works, how it was built, and what the results look like. It documents:

- **The Pipeline**: A 6-phase system (quote extraction → retrieval → generation → scoring → footnoting → tagging) that transforms multi-author biblical commentary into 30–80 word summary paragraphs
- **Commentary Digitization**: Two major volunteer efforts to digitize Alford's NT commentary (2,544 pages, 28 volunteers) and Govett's Revelation commentary (627 pages)
- **Original Language Tagging**: Mapping every word in the Bible to its Hebrew/Greek Strong's concordance number (321K tagged occurrences)
- **Evaluation**: Quality metrics across 7,957 NT and 10,492 OT verses, generation strategy comparisons, and human evaluation results
- **The Platform**: BibleGo.org — a deployed web app with commentary reading, word study (Word Donut), and full commentator browsing

## Building the Paper

**Prerequisites**: A TeX distribution with `pdflatex` and `bibtex` (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX).

```bash
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode paper.tex
bibtex paper
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode paper.tex
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode paper.tex
```

Three `pdflatex` passes are needed for cross-references and bibliography. Output: `paper.pdf`.

**To regenerate charts** (requires Python with matplotlib, numpy):
```bash
python generate_charts.py
```
Note: This reads BHT JSON data from `../bht/` which is not included in this repo.
